These are mostly my personal notes regarding software development or setup. 
Some of them assume some kind of customized setup of mine, but I thought they could still be helpful. 
If you have any questions just ask me :)  
I host my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mo-krauti) and [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~mo_k/).
